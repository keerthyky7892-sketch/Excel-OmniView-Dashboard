ðŸ“Œ Short Notes for Using Formulas (Highlighted)

Replace Table and Column Names â€“ Use your own table name instead of OmniView and the correct column names.

Adjust Filter Values â€“ Replace "Asia", "2000s", "Yes" with your actual categories or criteria.

PivotTables Setup â€“

Rows: Select the category (e.g., Decade, Region, Country)

Values: Select the field (e.g., Avg_Income_USD) and choose Average/Sum

Slicers: Add for interactive filtering.

KPI Cards â€“ Use GETPIVOTDATA to fetch a single Pivot value for dashboards.

Dynamic Formulas â€“ UNIQUE, FILTER, LARGE can show top items or filtered lists; adjust for your dataset.

Test & Verify â€“ Always check formulas with a small sample of data before using them in your dashboard.
